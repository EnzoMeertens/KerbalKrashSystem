Kerbal Krash System


DESCRIPTION:

Kerbal Krash System rewrites collisions in Kerbal Space Program. KKS deforms your creations and reduces the efficiency of your crafts instead of just exploding on impact:

Damage occur on impacting anything (oceans, buildings, parts, kerbals, ground, ...) at speeds exceeding the part's original crash tolerance limits:
Crash tolerances are scaled by (configurable) factors, this allows parts to be damaged instead of exploding on exceeding the original crash tolerance.
Parts impacting at speeds above the scaled crash tolerance explode as normal.
Damaged engines overheat more quickly,
Damaged containers leak, including leaking effects,
Damaged command pods will have malfunctioning crew hatches,
Science modules become inoperable when damaged and need both engineers as well as scientists to be fully restored,
Damaged parts can be repaired using Engineers:
Lower level engineers are able to repair once every 55 seconds (lowered by ten seconds per experience level),
Higher level engineers are able to repair more often (up to once every five seconds).
Future update: KIS support: use "attachment tools" like the screwdriver or wrench to repair, instead of bare hands (or whatever Kerbals have... 'kands'?).
 

KKS scales crash tolerances such that parts don't explode on impact, but rather get damaged when they collide.

 

This mod should be easy to incorporate into other mods, e.g. TAC Life Support can access the damage percentage of command pods to drain oxygen.
